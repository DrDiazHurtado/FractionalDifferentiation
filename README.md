# FractionalDifferentiation
Fractional differentiation extracts long-term trends while preserving essential information in time series data with finer differentiation orders.By applying fractional differentiation with a fractional order (like 0.5 in the code), it becomes possible to manipulate the time series data to emphasize either the long-term trends or remove short-term fluctuations, depending on the chosen fractional order. Remind environme nt is MT running on Linux so the command from mt5linux import MetaTrader5 must be run having a Wine running both Python and MT5 for windows.
